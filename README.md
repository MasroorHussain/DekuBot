Dekubot is a general purpose discord chat-bot. It performs various different tasks, some of which are listed below.

## Cool stuff DekuBot does

* General server utils such as having a welcome message
* Creating feeds for the new posts on a subreddit
* Works as a music bot by playing yotube links
* Tracking new releases of manga as they are released on [Mangastream](http://mangastream.com/)
* Creating custom commands
* A whole bunch of other stuff yo

## Adding the bot to your server

* The way to add Dekubot to your server is to simply use the [Invite link](http://mangastream.com/). From that page you can add the bot to any server where you have manage_server permissions 

* For a list of commands I recommend reading the [Wiki](https://github.com/RoddersGH/DekuBot/wiki/General-Commands) we have here on this repository as it has a comprehensive list of every command and how they can be used

* If you have any further questions or you want to help in the development of DekuBot then please join our [discord server](https://discord.gg/we8bdxJ) 

## Installation

* A guide for installation will be coming shortly and I appreciate your patience
